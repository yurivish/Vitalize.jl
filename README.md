# Vitalize

This is an early release of Vitalize. While it has been used for production-quality work, please regard it as closer to a proof of concept at this time -- it's possible the core abstractions may still change.

If you're curious to see how a simple example works, have a look at the `examples` folder. The examples can be run simply by viewing the corresponding .html file in your browser.
